# Coq Formalization

This directory contains the Coq formalization of our compilation scheme.
The core of the formalization is an elaboration semantics from λ<sub>i</sub><sup>+</sup> to λ<sub>r</sub>.
We mechanically prove the type safety of the elaboration, among other theorems.

## How to Build?

The proofs are tested against [Coq 8.16.1](https://github.com/coq/coq/releases/tag/V8.16.1).
Note that Ott/LNgen may not work on newer versions of Coq.
The easiest way to install Coq 8.16.1 is using opam:

```
$ opam pin add coq 8.16.1
```

[StructTact](https://github.com/uwplse/StructTact), [Metalib](https://github.com/plclub/metalib) and auxiliary files for Ott are required to build our code. You can also install them using opam:

```
$ opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
$ opam install coq-struct-tact coq-metalib coq-ott
```

After installing Coq and the required libraries, you can execute `make` under the `coq/` subdirectory. A successful build would be like:

```
$ cd coq
$ make
......
coq_makefile -arg '-w -deprecated,-fragile-hint-constr' -f _CoqProject -o CoqSrc.mk
COQDEP VFILES
COQC LibTactics.v
COQC syntax_ott.v
COQC source_inf.v
COQC target_inf.v
COQC Infrastructure.v
COQC TargetTypeSafety.v
COQC Translation.v
COQC ElaborationSoundness.v
```

### Sidenote: Locally Nameless

Most locally nameless definitions and proofs are automatically generated.
The command line tools [Ott](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott) and [LNgen](https://github.com/plclub/lngen) are used to generate `coq/syntax_ott.v` and `coq/{source,target}_inf.v`.
You can build all Coq proofs without installing Ott/LNgen.

However, if you modify `ott/{source,target}.ott`, you may want to regenerate those Coq files.
Simply executing `make all` instead of `make` should do the job.
Note that some manual work is needed after regenerating `coq/syntax_ott.v`.
We apologize that we have not automated the modifications so far.

## Directory Structure

- [ott/](./ott) for the Ott specification, which is used to generate the locally nameless definitions and proofs in Coq.
- [coq/](./coq) for the Coq formalization.
  + [LibTactics.v](./coq/LibTactics.v) is borrowed from a chapter of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/LibTactics.html).
  + [syntax_ott.v](./coq/syntax_ott.v) contains the locally nameless definitions.
  + [source_inf.v](./coq/source_inf.v) and [target_inf.v](./coq/target_inf.v) contain the locally nameless lemmas.
  + [Infrastructure.v](./coq/Infrastructure.v) contains the notation definitions and auxiliary tactics.
  + [TargetTypeSafety.v](./coq/TargetTypeSafety.v) proves the type soundness of the target calculus in Section 5.1.
  + [Translation.v](./coq/Translation.v) contains the proofs about translation functions at the beginning of Section 5.2.
  + [ElaborationSoundness.v](./coq/ElaborationSoundness.v) contains the proofs about the type-directed elaboration from the source calculus to the target calculus. It corresponds to the last paragraph of Section 5.2.
