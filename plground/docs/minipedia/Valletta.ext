\Body[
\Section[Valletta]
\Bold[Valletta] (/vəˈlɛtə/, Maltese: il-Belt Valletta) is the capital city of \Href("Malta")[Malta]. Located in the South Eastern Region of the main island, between Marsamxett Harbour to the west and the Grand Harbour to the east, its population in 2014 was 6,444,\Cite("ref4") while the metropolitan area around it has a population of 393,938.\Cite("ref2") Valletta is second only to Nicosia as the southernmost capital of Europe,\Cite("ref5") and at just 0.61 square kilometres (61 ha), it is the European Union's smallest capital city.\Cite("ref6")\Cite("ref7")
\\
Valletta's 16th-century buildings were constructed by the Knights Hospitaller. The city was named after Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege of Malta. The city is Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture, though the Second World War left major scars on the city, particularly the destruction of the Royal Opera House. The city was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.\Cite("ref8")
\\
The city is noted for its fortifications, consisting of bastions, curtains and cavaliers, along with the beauty of its Baroque palaces, gardens and churches.
\\
\Section[History]
The peninsula was previously called Xagħret Mewwija (Mu' awiya – Meuia; named during the Arab period\Cite("ref9"))\Cite("ref10")\Cite("ref11") or Ħal Newwija.\Cite("ref12") Mewwija refers to a sheltered place.\Cite("ref13") The extreme end of the peninsula was known as Xebb ir-Ras (Sheb point), of which name origins from the lighthouse on site.\Cite("ref14")\Cite("ref15") A family which surely owned land became known as Sceberras, now a Maltese surname as Sciberras.\Cite("ref16") At one point the entire peninsula became known as Sceberras.
\\
\SubSection[Order of Saint John]
The building of a city on the Sciberras Peninsula had been proposed by the Order of Saint John as early as 1524.\Cite("ref17") Back then, the only building on the peninsula was a small watchtower\Cite("ref18") dedicated to Erasmus of Formia (Saint Elmo), which had been built in 1488.\Cite("ref19")
\\
In 1552, the Aragonite watchtower was demolished and the larger Fort Saint Elmo was built in its place.\Cite("ref20")
\\
In the Great Siege of 1565, Fort Saint Elmo fell to the Ottomans, but the Order eventually won the siege with the help of Sicilian reinforcements. The victorious Grand Master, Jean de Valette, immediately set out to build a new fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula to fortify the Order's position in Malta and bind the Knights to the island. The city took his name and was called La Valletta.\Cite("ref21")
\\
The Grand Master asked the European kings and princes for help, receiving a lot of assistance due to the increased fame of the Order after their victory in the Great Siege. Pope Pius V sent his military architect, Francesco Laparelli, to design the new city, while Philip II of Spain sent substantial monetary aid. The foundation stone of the city was laid by Grand Master de Valette on 28 March 1566. He placed the first stone in what later became Our Lady of Victories Church.\Cite("ref22")
\\
In his book Dell’Istoria della Sacra Religione et Illustrissima Militia di San Giovanni Gierosolimitano (English: The History of the Sacred Religion and Illustrious Militia of St John of Jerusalem), written between 1594 and 1602, Giacomo Bosio writes that when the cornerstone of Valletta was placed, a group of Maltese elders said: "Iegi zimen en fel wardia col sceber raba iesue uquie" (Which in modern Maltese reads, "Jiġi żmien li fil-Wardija kull xiber raba' jiswa uqija", and in English, "There will come a time when every piece of land on Sciberras Hill will be worth its weight in gold").\Cite("ref23")
\\
De Valette died from a stroke on 21 August 1568 at age 74 and never saw the completion of his city. Originally interred in the church of Our Lady of the Victories, his remains now rest in St. John's Co-Cathedral among the tombs of other Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta.\Cite("ref22")
\\
Francesco Laparelli was the city's principal designer and his plan departed from medieval Maltese architecture, which exhibited irregular winding streets and alleys. He designed the new city on a rectangular grid plan, and without any collacchio (an area restricted for important buildings). The streets were designed to be wide and straight, beginning centrally from the City Gate and ending at Fort Saint Elmo (which was rebuilt) overlooking the Mediterranean; certain bastions were built 47 metres (154 ft) high. His assistant was the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar, who later oversaw the construction of the city himself after Laparelli's death in 1570.\Cite("ref22")
\\
The Ufficio delle Case regulated the building of the city as a planning authority.\Cite("ref24")
\\
The city of Valletta was mostly completed by the early 1570s, and it became the capital on 18 March 1571 when Grand Master Pierre de Monte moved from his seat at Fort St Angelo in Birgu to the Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta.
\\
Seven Auberges were built for the Order's Langues, and these were complete by the 1580s.\Cite("ref25")\Cite("ref26") An eighth Auberge, Auberge de Bavière, was later added in the 18th century.\Cite("ref27")
\\
In Antoine de Paule's reign, it was decided to build more fortifications to protect Valletta, and these were named the Floriana Lines after the architect who designed them, Pietro Paolo Floriani of Macerata.\Cite("ref28") During António Manoel de Vilhena's reign, a town began to form between the walls of Valletta and the Floriana Lines, and this evolved from a suburb of Valletta to Floriana, a town in its own right.\Cite("ref29")
\\
In 1634, a gunpowder factory explosion killed 22 people in Valletta.\Cite("ref30") In 1749, Muslim slaves plotted to kill Grandmaster Pinto and take over Valletta, but the revolt was suppressed before it even started due to their plans leaking out to the Order.\Cite("ref31") Later on in his reign, Pinto embellished the city with Baroque architecture, and many important buildings such as Auberge de Castille were remodeled or completely rebuilt in the new architectural style.\Cite("ref32")
\\
In 1775, during the reign of Ximenes, an unsuccessful revolt known as the Rising of the Priests occurred in which Fort Saint Elmo and Saint James Cavalier were captured by rebels, but the revolt was eventually suppressed.\Cite("ref33")
\\
\SubSection[French occupation and British rule]
In 1798, the French invaded the island and expelled the Order.\Cite("ref34") After the Maltese rebelled, French troops continued to occupy Valletta and the surrounding harbour area, until they capitulated to the British in September 1800. In the early 19th century, the British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, agreed to demolish the majority of the city's fortifications.\Cite("ref35") The demolition was again proposed in the 1870s and 1880s, but it was never carried out and the fortifications have survived largely intact.\Cite("ref17")
\\
Eventually building projects in Valletta resumed under British rule. These projects included widening gates, demolishing and rebuilding structures, widening newer houses over the years, and installing civic projects. The Malta Railway, which linked Valletta to Mdina, was officially opened in 1883.\Cite("ref36") It was closed down in 1931 after buses became a popular means of transport.
\\
In 1939, Valletta was abandoned as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Mediterranean Fleet due to its proximity to Italy and the city became a flash point during the subsequent two-year long Siege of Malta.\Cite("ref37") German and Italian air raids throughout the Second World War caused much destruction in Valletta and the rest of the harbor area. The Royal Opera House, constructed at the city entrance in the 19th century, was one of the buildings lost to the raids.\Cite("ref20")
\\
\SubSection[Contemporary]
In 1980, the 24th Chess Olympiad took place in Valletta.\Cite("ref38")
\\
The entire city of Valletta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980, along with Megalithic Temples of Malta and the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni.\Cite("ref8")\Cite("ref39") On 11 November 2015 Valletta hosted the Valletta Summit on Migration in which European and African leaders discussed the European migrant crisis.\Cite("ref40") After that, on 27 November 2015 the city also hosted part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015.\Cite("ref41")

The architecture of Valletta's streets and piazzas ranges from mid-16th century Baroque to Modernism. The city is the island's principal cultural center and has a unique collection of churches, palaces and museums and act as one of the city's main visitor attractions. When Benjamin Disraeli, future British Prime Minister, visited the city in 1830, he described it as "a city of palaces built by gentlemen for gentlemen," and remarked that "Valletta equals in its noble architecture, if it does not excel, any capital in Europe," and in other letters called it "comparable to Venice and Cádiz" and "full of palaces worthy of Palladio."\Cite("ref61")\Cite("ref62")

\\
The National Museum of Fine Arts is a Rococo palace dating back to the late 1570s, which served as the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet during the British era from the 1820s onwards. The Manoel Theatre (Maltese: Teatru Manoel) was constructed in just ten months in 1731, by order of Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena, and is one of the oldest working theatres in Europe. The Mediterranean Conference Centre was formerly the Sacra Infermeria. Built in 1574, it was one of Europe's most renowned hospitals during the Renaissance. The fortifications of the port, built by the Knights as a magnificent series of bastions, demi-bastions, cavaliers and curtains, approximately 100 metres (330 ft) high, all contribute to the unique architectural quality of the city.
